<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A learning management system (LMS) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses or training programs.<p>

<h1>Problem definition</h1>
<ul>
<li> The absence of a system that connects the students with their instructor, courses description, grades tracking and their department affairs was one of the main problems that we’ve been exposed to during our last 3 years.</li>
<li> Communication through Facebook and Google Forms was not a proper solution for our problem. </li>
</ul>
